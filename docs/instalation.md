The lastest version of python should work for this library

In the terminal run the following command to install the library
```python
>>> pip install speedrunapi
```
Great! Now the library is installed!
<br>
To use the libray in your own project, add this code
```python
import speedrunapi
```
To simplify the name to something easier to type use the as command to change the package name for your project, as seen below.
```python
import speedrunapi as sr
```
Now that you have the library installed and imported you can use it to work with speedrun.com's API!

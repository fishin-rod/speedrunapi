Translation
===
Speedrun.com's api provides ids instead of the name of the thing you are searching for.
The translations module allows you to translate the ids into names you can read.
The translations module also works backworks by translating some names into ids (Sadly not fully supported yet).
This modlue should be built into the code but in the rare chance that it isnt it can be used by the user aswell.
